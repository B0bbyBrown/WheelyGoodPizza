## Development Workflow

We use a simple feature branching workflow:

1.  **Fork the repository**.
2.  **Create a new branch** from `main` for your feature or bug fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
    ```
3.  **Make your changes** and commit them with clear and descriptive messages.
4.  **Push your branch** to your fork.
5.  **Open a pull request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.
