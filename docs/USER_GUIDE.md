    -   **Email**: `admin@pizzatruck.com`
    -   **Password**: `admin123`
    It is recommended to change the default password after your first login.
2.  **Initial Configuration**: Before you can start making sales, you need to set up your core data:
    -   **Suppliers**: Add your suppliers in the "Purchases" section.
    -   **Ingredients**: Define all your ingredients and their units on the "Inventory" page.
    -   **Products**: Create your menu items on the "Products" page and define their recipes using the ingredients you've added.

## User Roles

The system is designed with different user roles to manage access to various features.
-   **Administrator**: Has full access to all features, including system configuration, financial reports, and user management.
-   **Cashier**: Primarily responsible for processing sales, managing cash sessions, and viewing inventory.
-   **Kitchen Staff**: Focuses on food preparation, with access to recipe information and stock monitoring.

## Daily Operations Workflow

### 1. Opening for the Day
-   **Open a Cash Session**: Navigate to the "Sessions" page, count your starting cash, and open a new session with that amount.
-   **Inventory Check**: Review the "Inventory" page for any low-stock alerts and plan your prep and purchases accordingly.

### 2. During Service
-   **Processing Sales**: Use the "Sales" page to create new orders. The system will automatically check for sufficient ingredient stock based on the recipes of the products you add.
-   **Receiving Deliveries**: When you receive new stock, go to the "Purchases" page to record a new purchase. This will add the items to your inventory.
-   **Stock Adjustments**: If you need to account for waste, spoilage, or other discrepancies, use the "Adjust Stock" feature on the "Inventory" page.

### 3. Closing for the Day
-   **Close Cash Session**: At the end of the day, go to the "Sessions" page, count your closing cash, and close the active session. The system will calculate any variance.
-   **Review Reports**: Check the "Dashboard" and "Reports" pages for an overview of the day's sales, top products, and financial performance.
